# Link-Keepa

This is a work in progress chrome extension that enables chrome users to store links of various websites.
This is a first version and also a learn by doing project which has a few other features that haven't been integrated :)


Directions to use Link Keepa:

1️⃣ Download the zip file of the source code
2️⃣ Go to chrome settings
3️⃣ Go to Extensions
4️⃣ Turn on developer mode
5️⃣ Click on Load Unpacked
6️⃣ Select the downloaded zip folder
7️⃣ Go to the website you want to save, copy and paste the url into the extension input box :)
8️⃣ Hit save! Phew, you're done.

NOTE: I am currently learning localStorage() in Javascript in order for our saved links to get stored to the DOM
even after closing our extension :)
